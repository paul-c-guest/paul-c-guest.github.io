    <h1>Neuroplasticity and a Growth Mindset</h1>

    <h2>Why learn about neuroplasticity?</h2>
    <p>
      Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to change, and adapt to new
      situations. OK, you might think, that's fine and obvious in a way &mdash;
      so why put effort into finding out more than that?
    </p>
    <p>
      The important point about neuroplasticity, is that once people are given
      the knowledge that we can work on changing our brain to learn new things
      (at any age), we are more likely to have a go at learning new things! It's
      this point that makes the subject far more valuable to know about, as it
      relates to your very own learning abilities.
    </p>

    <p>
      These academic and scientific discoveries about how we learn, and how
      abilities are reinforced in memory, allow us to maximise the outcomes of a
      well-planned structure of learning & practice.
    </p>

    <h2>How do I increase neuroplasticity?</h2>
    <p>
      A routine of learning and practice will, over time, develop better neural
      pathways for the task you are aiming to strengthen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Set challenging goals: acknowledge that it will be challenging, don't give
      up, and practice toward the goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Practice should be <strong>deliberate</strong>. There is plenty of
      material just on
      <a href="https://fs.blog/deliberate-practice-guide/" target="_blank">this subject</a>
      alone. On important point is to put aside time to practice for short,
      focussed sessions (there is little reward for continuing when exhausted) ,
      and allow time between sessions.

    <h2>What is a growth mindset?</h2>
    <p>This could be described in quite a few different ways. The way that I think about it is around how a person might react to challenges, or to failure. Does the person see a door slamming closed, or a new door opening? Does the person already forecast what they're capable of before giving something a try, or do they just give it a try?</p>
    <p>The growth mindset is the opposite of the fixed mindset. Each mindset comes with a few giveaway characteristics, which impact on the bearer's outlook on navigating the world.</p>
    <p>And please note &mdash; we don't all just fall into one camp or the other. We might hold a fixed mindset for one aspect of our life while having a growth mindset in another; or even a complex middle-ground.</p>
