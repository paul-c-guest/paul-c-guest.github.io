    <h1>Neuroplasticity and a Growth Mindset</h1>
    <h3 class="date">3 July 2023</h3>

    <h2>Why learn about neuroplasticity?</h2>
    <p>
      Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to change and adapt to new
      situations. Sure sure, you might think, that's fine and obvious &mdash;
      why put effort into finding out more than that?
    </p>
    <p>
      The important point about neuroplasticity, is that once people are given
      the knowledge that we can work on changing our brain to learn new things
      (at any age), we are more likely to have a go at learning new things! It's
      this point that makes the subject far more valuable to know about, as it
      relates to your very own learning abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      These academic and scientific discoveries about how we learn, and how
      abilities are reinforced in memory, allow us to maximise the outcomes of a
      well-planned structure of learning & practice.
    </p>

    <h2>How do I increase neuroplasticity?</h2>
    <p>
      A routine of learning and practice will, over time, develop better neural
      pathways for the task you are aiming to strengthen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Set challenging goals: acknowledge that it will be challenging, don't give
      up, and practice toward the goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Practice should be <strong>deliberate</strong>. There is a wealth of
      material on
      <a href="https://fs.blog/deliberate-practice-guide/" target="_blank"
        >deliberate practice</a
      >
      alone. One important point is practicing for short,
      focussed sessions (there is little reward for continuing when exhausted) ,
      and allowing time between sessions.

    <h2>What is a growth mindset?</h2>
    <p>
      This could be described in quite a few different ways. The way that I
      think about it is around how a person might react to challenges, or to
      failure. Does the person see a door slamming closed, or a new door
      opening? Does the person already forecast what they're capable of before
      giving something a try, or do they just give it a try?
    </p>
    <p>
      The growth mindset is the opposite of the fixed mindset. Each mindset
      comes with a few giveaway characteristics, which impact on the bearer's
      outlook on navigating the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      And please note &mdash; we don't all just fall into one camp or the other.
      We might hold a fixed mindset for one aspect of our life while having a
      growth mindset in another; or even a complex middle-ground.
    </p>
    <h2>Surprising outcomes</h2>
    <p>
      People with fixed mindsets are more likely to lie about their abilities.
      Why would this be? While those with a growth mindset are likely to freely
      expose their knowledge gaps and want to fill them; those with fixed
      mindsets are more likely to consider that their skillset was there from
      childhood, unchanging and potentially emmarrassing &mdash; something to
      cover up as an unchangeable weakness.
    </p>
    <h2>How will I incorporate this into my learning?</h2>
    <p>
      Knowing this about mindsets, I will work to recognise opportunities for
      learning and development; to acknowledge my reactions to challenges and
      roadblocks and guide those reactions towards a desire to put in the time
      to understand the problem and the way forward.
