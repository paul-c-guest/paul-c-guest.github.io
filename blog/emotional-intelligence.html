    <p class="question">What is Emotional Intelligence?</p>
    <p>
      In my own words: it is an ability to recognise emotional states in
      yourself and in others, and to act and react in a constructive manner.
    </p>

    <p class="question">How is EQ different to IQ?</p>
    <p>
      Well: if IQ is how good you are at understanding and solving problems that
      are best suited to your logical or rational side, then EQ is something
      akin to your ability to do the same for <em>emotional</em> problems.
    </p>

    <p class="question">Why is EQ important?</p>
    <p>
      As people in societies, we are not only presented with technical, logical
      problems from day to day. The problems we face each day will likely hold
      some emotional aspect, whether those emotions are our own, someone elses,
      or both; and can come as part of a technical problem at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being capable of working through all kinds of challenges, towards
      constructive outcomes, is surely better for everyone.
