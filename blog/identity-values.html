    <h1>Identity, Values, and Strengths Exploration</h1>
    <h3 class="date">24 June 2023</h3>

    <p class="question">
      Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
      you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
      made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've chosen to not eat meat if I can avoid it. The reasons are ethical,
      and a bit ecological. Basically what it comes down to is that I don't need
      animals to die so I can stay alive. But what makes animals special enough
      that they shouldn't be dying to fill my freezer? Really the more complex
      standpoint is around the very small range of animals that we have chosen
      to farm intensively, and the crazy use of resources that requires.
    </p>
    <p>
      The big thing that changed wasn't 'not eating meat', but becoming the
      vegetarian at the barbecue; the vegetarian at the restaurant. Unless that
      barbecue was fired up just to char some vegetables, being that guy throws
      off the social situation a bit (come on, don't kid yourself). Of course
      this is a pretty flimsy excuse to make a U-turn; and ultimately it has
      been quite easy to deal with.
    </p>
    <p>I'm still happy with my decision.</p>
    <p class="question">
      Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
      values and identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      From moment to moment it can seem blindly obvious or completely unknowable
      what my culture is. As an english-speaking white guy in his forties that
      has a road-legal car and no debts, it's sometimes easy to focus on those
      aspects that others have quick access to, and lazily put myself in that
      big category.
    </p>

      A story I tell people is that since I grew up in the 80s in Newtown,
      Wellington, I didn't realise how particularly diverse my community was -
      and also how homogeneous other parts of Wellington were. Newtown has
      commonly been a place where immigrants and refugees can get accomodation
      (including the family on my mum's side), but as a kid I just took that all
      at face value. Being there surely contributed to my values and identity -
      I feel that I judge people by their actions and not by whichever culture
      they might appear to fit into.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning
      journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can be a focussed investigator if something interesting strikes me as
      requiring some sudden and deep research. So, rather than creating endless
      rabbit-holes to disappear down, I can deploy this as a well-practiced
      strategy - rapid research and digestion to get just the information I need
      and move on.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've never really stopped learning! I like learning something new every
      day and am able to take on new concepts and approaches quickly. I desire
      knowledge.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
      development. How might these affect your learning journey?
    </p>
    <p>
      Right now I've made myself a lot of room, and dropped a couple of things,
      to focus almost singularly on this learning journey. I don't feel
      particularly limited, but I am probably prone to being easily distracted
      if I'm not invested in what I'm doing.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others,
      but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the
      time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other
      strategies you would try now and why.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keeping a commercial coffee machine clean is important (and not just clean
      on the outside). However, plenty of baristas have learned bad habits from
      others, or just don't get paid enough to care. This was a constant battle
      for me, as a head barista at a busy cafe.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a particular person that really didn't care to follow best
      practices. One evening I tried to challenge them properly about their
      habits, man-splaining the reason for a certain cleaning process, and
      rearranging the equipment to show them what I meant. Surely reason &
      practical application would win the day! Nope. They wasted no time in
      putting it back the way they liked it (a configuration that would, over
      time, damage the machine!).
    </p>
    <p>
      OK. Now what? It was the end of the day so I was easily dragged to their
      level. I put it back my way. They put it back their way. Yeah now we're
      really getting nowhere together.
    </p>
    <p>
      I kept it together, and had a deep breath. "I'm going to start getting
      pretty angry about this" I forecasted. The recommendation that came back
      was something in the vein of "well just don't look".
    </p>
    <p>
      That person didn't care to update their habits. I think I had to leave it
      at that, and just ensure they weren't doing the daily clean. I'm happy
      that I kept it human, and didn't do or say anything horrible. So what
      might I try today? It might've been best to not engage from the start, and
      revisit the topic some other day, at the start of the day. Maybe I
      should've stuck to just using words, and not physically changing their
      setup, which probably just increased the likelihood of beligerence.
