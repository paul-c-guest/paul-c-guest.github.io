    # Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.

    I've had to make a big decision affecting someone else before, and I'd rather not talk about the situation. It took a while to figure it out, but the most helpful were a range of articles putting forward different prompts designed to evoke a reaction which might aid me out of the fog. Ultimately, the decision I made was a selfish one, and I am happy with that decision.
    
    # Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.
    
    From moment to moment it can seem blindly obvious or completely unknowable what my culture is. As an english-speaking white guy in his forties that has a road-legal car and no debts, it's sometimes easy to focus on those aspects that others have quick access to, and lazily put myself in that big category.
    
    A story I tell people is that since I grew up in the 80s in Newtown, Wellington, I didn't realise how particularly diverse my community was - and also how homogeneous other parts of Wellington were. Newtown has commonly been a place where immigrants and refugees can get accomodation (including the family on my mum's side), but as a kid I just took that all at face value. Being there surely contributed to my values and identity - I feel that I judge people by their actions and not by whichever culture they might appear to fit into.
    
    # Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.
    
    I can be a focussed investigator if something interesting strikes me as requiring some sudden and deep research. So, rather than creating endless rabbit-holes to disappear down, I can deploy this as a well-practiced strategy - rapid research and digestion to get just the information I need and move on.
    
    I've never really stopped learning! I like learning something new every day and am able to take on new concepts and approaches quickly. I desire knowledge.
    
    # Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?
    
    There are surely some limitations. Though right now I've made myself a lot of room, and dropped a couple of things, to focus almost singularly on this learning journey. I don't feel particularly limited. 
    
    # Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
