    <h2>The Astronomical Clock</h2>
    <p>
      There's a few "must-see!" tourist attraction in Prague, one of them being
      a building housing a number of giant clock faces which keep track of a
      number of events (beyond just the hour and minute); and a crew of
      mechanised characters that wiggle about at particular times, to the
      eternal delight of the audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll refer back to this analogy a few times during this article, as I
      explain how Javascript comes onto the scene when HTML and CSS can't
      satisfy our interactive requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get this clock rolling, we can start by considering that if we were
      building one of these complex beasts &mdash; not on the main square, but
      on a website &mdash; there would be a few predictable features to the
      design.
    </p>
    <p>
      The structure of the building, the frame that holds everything up, is
      going to be built using HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ornate detailing, the gold foil slathered everywhere, the roof tiles,
      the colour palette, the balance of the window sizes and positioning
      &mdash; these design decisions can be handled by CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beautiful! But does it actually do anything yet? We might be able to get
      some of the repetitive movements happening with CSS, however we'll quickly
      get to a point where we find that CSS isn't really the tool for the job of
      orchestrating the whole mechanism. There's a far better way to get the
      parts moving on the clock faces, to get those grotesque characters
      trundling along their tracks at the right time. Yup: it's Javascript.

    <h2>control flow and looping</h2>
    <p>example from life, and the clock</p>

    <h2>so whats the DOM</h2>
    <p>mansplain why its useful</p>

    <h2>how do i get at the info in arrays and objects?</h2>
    <p>oh jeez...</p>

    <h2>wut? well whats a function</h2>
    <p>
      that cake recipe that you've nailed, and another example from the clock
