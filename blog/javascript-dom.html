    <h2>The Astronomical Clock</h2>
    <p>
      There's a few "must-see!" tourist attraction in Prague, one of them being
      a building housing a number of giant clock faces which keep track of a
      number of events (beyond just the hour and minute); and a crew of
      mechanised characters that wiggle about at particular times, to the
      eternal delight of the audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll use this machine as our main analogy during this article, as I
      explain how Javascript comes onto the scene when HTML and CSS can't
      satisfy our interactive requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get this clock rolling, we can start by considering that if we were
      building one of these complex beasts &mdash; not on the main square, but
      on a website &mdash; there would be a few predictable features to the
      design.
    </p>
    <p>
      The structure of the building, the frame that holds everything up, is
      going to be built using HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ornate detailing, the gold foil slathered everywhere, the roof tiles,
      the colour palette, the balance of the window sizes and positioning
      &mdash; these design decisions can be handled by CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beautiful! But does it actually do anything yet? We might be able to get
      some of the repetitive movements happening with CSS, however we'll quickly
      get to a point where we find that CSS isn't really the tool for the job of
      orchestrating the whole mechanism. There's a far better way to get the
      parts moving on the clock faces, to get those grotesque characters
      trundling along their tracks at the right time. Yup: it's Javascript.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Javascript (JS), we can set out the instructions for arrangements as complex as we can dream up, where, for
      example:
      <ul>
        <li>
          some process can continue forever <br>(the hands on the clock keep going)
        </li>
        <li>
          some regular event can happen when required <br>(ring the bells every hour)
        </li>
        <li>
          events trigger other events <br>(the mechanical characters come out at certain hours)
        </li>
        <li>
          events wait for others to finish <br>(the interactions of the characters are coordinated)
        </li>
        <li>
          decisions can be guided by the states of other parts <br>(don't ring the bells at night!)
        </li>
      </ul> 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you should start to see the value and versatility of bringing the clock to life with JS. We'll continue delving into some of the features of JS to reinforce some of the concepts.
    </p>

    <h2>Loops and Control Flow</h2>
    <p>Loops are bread-and-butter for any programming language, and they really are what they sound like. Think of some process that would probably keep going if it wasn't stopped. Clocks have hands that continually move around the face, and something has to change before they'll stop.</p>
    <p>Consider the task of walking. A programmer might express the repetitive nature of getting somewhere on foot like this:</p>
    <div class="code-block">
      <pre class="preformatted-code-block">while nothing is in the way
{ left foot, right foot }</pre>
    </div>
<p>This block of "pseudo-code" (it might not work as real code) has a couple of features. The first line is a 'condition', which gives the loop an idea of whether to continue with the task. The second line is a list of things to do in a loop, and is bundled up in some curly brackets. After every single loop, the program will check again whether 'nothing is in the way'.</p>
<p>A JS programmer might actually write something like this:</p>
<div class="code-block">
  <pre class="preformatted-code-block">while (clearPathAhead) {
  leftFootForward()
  rightFootForward()    
}</pre>
    </div>
    <p>There are suddenly a few more JS-specific language features, but the result would be the same. Don't panic, we'll get through all of it by the end of the article.</p>
    <p>What if we can't sustain our infinite walk in one direction? A wild crowd of tourists appears! As soon as the <code>clearPathAhead</code> condition can't be satisfied, the program will break out of that loop &mdash; and look for further instructions.</p>
    <p>We can expand our program to start dealing with more situations:</p>
    <div class="code-block">
      <pre class="preformatted-code-block">while (clearPathAhead) {
  leftFootForward()
  rightFootForward()   
} 
turnLeft()</pre>
</div>
<p>Now, if the condition can't be satisfied when the loop repeats, the loop will break out of its cycle, and the next operation will be a left turn.</p>
<p>
  Loops that are created using <code>while</code> are going out of fashion. It is far more common to see loops created in one of the <code>for</code> styles, and we'll get there shortly. Let's expand our current example to make it a repetitive task with a foreseeable end, like taking 10 steps forward. We'll add a place to keep track of our step count, and start spacing things out for clarity:
</p>
<div class="code-block">
  <pre class="preformatted-code-block">let stepCount = 0

while (stepCount < 11) {

  leftFootForward()
  stepCount = stepCount + 1

  rightFootForward()   
  stepCount = stepCount + 1

}</pre>
</div>
<p>
So now we've got a program that keeps track of the step count, incrementing the count after each step. The loop will break once the condition isn't true any more, i.e. when the stepCount goes over 10.
</p>
    <p>All of this can be expressed with a <code>for</code> loop, and it really is just a rearrangement of what we've got going on already:</p>
<div class="code-block">
  <pre class="preformatted-code-block">for (let stepCount = 0; stepCount < 11; stepCount++) {

  leftFootForward()
  rightFootForward()   

}</pre>
</div>
<p>You should be able to see how each piece came from the <code>while</code> structure above. I've slipped in another new thing, which is a shortcut for incrementing the stepCount with <code>++</code>. So now there's a bit more work up-front to set up the loop, but the part that we're looping can be understood much better.</p>

<h3>...and what if...?</h3>
<p>When we need to deal with uncertainty, we can use flow control. Think of the classic visual flow-chart. It often starts with a question, and there will be different paths to follow depending on the answers to the questions. Flow control is another bread-and-butter concept that programmers deal with all the time.</p>
<p>Here's the most basic form of an <code>if</code> statement, which checks a condition, and performs the instructions only if the condition passes.</p>
<div class="code-block">
  <pre class="preformatted-code-block">if (daytime) {

  ringTheBell()

}</pre>
</div>
<p>We can provide a block of follow-up code for failed condition tests:</p>
<div class="code-block">
  <pre class="preformatted-code-block">if (daytime) {

  ringTheBigBell()

} else {

  ringTheLittleBell()

}</pre>
</div>
<p>We can provide any number of intermediate steps. Pay attention to the new <code>else if</code> syntax in the middle:</p>

<div class="code-block">
  <pre class="preformatted-code-block">if (daytime) {

  ringTheBigBell()

} else if (midnightNewYearsDay) {

  playLaCucaracha()

} else {

  ringTheLittleBell()

}</pre>
</div>
<p>The program will 'flow' through the conditions until it finds one that should be acted on. The program will only act on the code for the first condition it finds to be correct, and then break out from that entire flow.</p>

<p>For certain situations, there is a completely different way to express a complex <code>if else</code> statement, called a <code>switch</code>. The format is quite different, but they get the same result. Often the decision to use one or the other can be down to personal perference or the clarity of the resulting code.</p>

<div class="code-block">
  <pre class="preformatted-code-block">switch (hour) {

  case 12:
    startFullPerformance()
    break
    
  case 9:
  case 15:
    startSimplePerformance()
    break

  case 21:
    startLateShow()
    break

  default:
    ringABell()

}</pre></div>
<p>Note that in a switch we need to explicitly tell the flow where to <code>break</code> free. If we didn't include that command, the flow would continue through the rest of the 'cases' and could run through more code than we intended. We can use this feature to our advantage, like in the section for the cases of 9 or 15.</p>
