    <p class="question">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</p>
    <p>
      In a nutsehll, Software. if its on the web or wherever i find myself, I
      compelteyl enjoy the process of busint gdown ever ylittle problem as they
      come up. secondly, I want to do that in a good team. I wouldn't have
      stayed in some of my previous jobs if it werent for the brilliant people
      that i got to be with every day. a team also means a range different
      skills, and i would look forward to the flow of knowledge and ideas that
      comes with that. i want the work i do to make some sort of real long term
      difference. e.g. my 6 seasons as a DOC ranger has made a real long term
      difference for the overall health of the arthurs pass national park. i
      could for example end up back at DOC, or at Groundtruth developing their
      trapping app.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
      Bootcamp?
    </p>
    <p>
      it certianly seems that my strentghs are in finding a solution with code
      relatively quickly, and i surprise myself that the foundation i built for
      myself in java some years is paying off big time. limitations would be
      forgetting to communicate with the team. I can sometimes just end up
      ploughing ahead when it could have been smarter to slow down and bring
      others along for the ride. sometimes i feel that i can take far too long
      on tasks. though really i have no idea how i could write some of the blog
      entries any faster than i do, while going well over the alloted 'timebox'.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
      be?
    </p>
    <p>
      it might turn out to be the inescapable effects of being an introvert.
      despite my deliberate attempts to overcome my shyness, long interactions
      with people are still simply draining. sometimes speaking in front of
      groups is a trainwreck, even if i know everyone.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed
      in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </p>
    <p>
      i am quite comfortable being a team-member, being tasked and completing
      work.. so i'd defintiely like to continue finding out what kind of leader
      i am, and learn how to really act as a leader rather than sort of fall in
      to that role.
    </p>
    <p class="question">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</p>
    <p>
      i want them to discover my weaknesses and push me out of the comfort zone.
      i'm here to get uncomfortable, and figure some stuff out in the sandpit
      before i make a real castle. 'support' from the team looks more like a
      push.
    </p>
    <p class="question">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</p>
    <p>
      i expect myself to 'turn up' every day. fresh, ready, alert, healthy,
      calm, undistracted. i will continue to be an inquisitive learner, and to
      be curious about the projects of others. i will treat everyone with
      friendliness but i can't promise that my sense of humour won't get in the
      way here adn there.

    <h1>Foundations Learning Plan</h1>

    <h3 class="date">24 June 2023</h3>

    <p class="question">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</p>
    <p>
      Long term, I'd like to be settled in a team of excellent people that I can
      have a laugh with. It's so much easier to do hard work with people when
      you're all in it together. I feel that everything's been coming together
      to this career decision (software development). It's taken many years and
      the time is now.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
    </p>
    <p>
      I can be a focussed investigator if something interesting strikes me as
      requiring some sudden and deep research. So, rather than creating endless
      rabbit-holes to disappear down, I can deploy this as a well-practiced
      strategy - rapid research and digestion to get just the information I need
      and move on.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've never really stopped learning! I like learning something new every
      day and am able to take on new concepts and approaches quickly. I desire
      knowledge and often choose to spend spare time in some kind of learning
      mode.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could be prone to easy distraction if I'm not really invested in what
      I'm learning.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
      developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </p>
    <p>
      I joined Dev Academy in part because I wanted the challenge of learning
      about web software <em>in a team environment</em>. It is very important to
      me that I gain these kinds of experiences; developing something that is so
      big that no single person can keep track of it all, requiring trust in
      your colleagues, empathy when something goes wrong, the human skills to
      navigate all this and still keep the project going.
    </p>

    <p class="question">
      A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This
      should include:
      <br />
      An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and
      safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community
      representatives
      <br />
      What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
    </p>
    <p>
      I will expect myself to 'show up to work' in the ordinary working hours of
      the week. Extra hours will likely spill over to times after dinner and
      mornings in the weekend. Most of my workload should therefore be taken
      care of by treating this as full-time employment &mdash; I should be
      present.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will assume that other learners are available for communication during
      similar 'working hours' unless I know otherwise; and will limit bothering
      them with anything if it seems like I wouldn't want to be bothered at that
      hour either.
    </p>
    <p>
      When things are building up and getting on top of me, I won't keep digging
      that hole! I'll go for a walk around the block, or remove myself from the
      task, and tell someone that I'm doing so, and for what reason.
    </p>

    <p class="question">
      A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
    </p>
    <p>
      When I recognise myself going round in circles for a bit, I'll reach out
      to others in my homegroup, or someone in particular if I know they'll be
      able to help; and explain my problem and what I've tried, where I think
      it's going wrong etc. I'll give enough time for suitable help before
      escalating if necessary to the facilitators &mdash; but I might also just
      go straight to them if it seems like I'll get quicker help.
    </p>
    <p>
      It'll be important to not keep digging my own hole in secret. I should
      call for help early, since someone else might have a simple answer or
      fresh eyes for the problem.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
    </p>
    <p>
      I expect that the facilitators will be helpful and respectful of my
      knowledge gaps, as I will be doing the same for other learners around me.
      I do not expect they'll just give me the answers, but I trust that they
      will be able to put me on the right track.
    </p>
    <p>
      I expect to be pushed by my facilitators, to be challenged to continually
      raise my standards.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed
      to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like
      school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would like to retain some pieces of my weekend just for myself &mdash;
      however at the same time I recognise that there will be some weekends
      where I'll need to just knuckle down and get something finished.
    </p>
    <p>I don't have any other scheduling conflicts or commitments.</p>
