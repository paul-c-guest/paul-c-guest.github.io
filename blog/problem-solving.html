    <h2>A Simple Problem</h2>
    <p>
      So, this one time at code camp &hellip; I was sure I had written this
      <code>fizzbuzz</code> function to perform exactly as was required.
      However, the tests kept throwing up screeds of errors and red text. I
      didn't really <em>read</em> the messages, but rather just scrolled through
      quite quickly to get a flavour of how much errors were being thrown at me.
      "What the hell?" I pondered to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I jumped back to my code, and combed through it again. Nope, still can't
      find a problem. I took a mental step back and noticed that the way I was
      running the tests meant that any other test with similar names in the
      title were also triggering!
    </p>
    <p>
      Gah! It was as simple as that. The function that I was trying to test had
      been passing tests all along &mdash; and I had been too easily distracted
      by the amount of red herrings to notice the short success message in the
      first place. I had to laugh at myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this I learned to pay attention to the bigger picture, to stop and
      step back for a wider view when things seem to be going wrong.
    </p>
    <h2>An Elegant Solution</h2>
    <p>
      I dropped myself in a deep end a few years ago. While still making
      baby-steps with Java, I put myself through an algorithms course. It was
      challenging from the very start! I vividly remember a particular
      first-week problem, and the moment when it all came together:
    </p>
    <p>
      The problem was around a concept called 'percolation'; discovering whether
      a porous substance might hold a way through the structure from one side to
      the other (think: determining if an unexplored cave network will get you
      through the mountain). Our task was to write the code that would test for
      this capacity in any supplied model &mdash; and that it would be optimised
      to work as quickly as the tutors knew it could!
    </p>
    <p>
      Silly me, I probably started by trying to write some code. I quickly went
      to pen & paper; drawing mazes and trying to understand how the tutors'
      code could solve each new case so quickly! The problem was too abstract to
      understand on paper, so I started talking about the problem with my
      partner (she was interested in what I was doing, but maybe not in this
      problem!). Little did I know I was rubber-ducking my way to a realisation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The process made me feel like I might have bitten off more than I could
      chew; but it also sparked something in me &mdash; I had to crack this (and
      I knew that many others before me had solved this). It was definitely
      frustrating to come up against a tough mental challenge after a few years
      of slack brain activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The solution came to me while I was trying to go to sleep. The problem had
      certainly consumed my thoughts for a couple of days, and while I felt at
      the time that the solution was so strange that it wasn't
      <em>elegant</em> &mdash; the proof was in how quickly it could correctly
      process all the test cases. The code became shorter as well, and still has
      a <code>eureka!</code> comment above

      that brought it all together.
    </p>
    <p>
      I learned that solving a problem with code was hardly about
      <em>writing the code!</em>

    <h2>Asking For Help</h2>
    <p>
      A time I was reluctant to ask for help: As part of a previous job, our
      team installed and used some bespoke techy hardware. I had a good
      relationship with the person that makes the gear, though felt like I was
      only ever asking for help or not solving my own problems before bothering
      them with our questions. So sometimes I limited the amount of contact I
      made with them, which was silly, and could have only meant things would
      take longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next time I notice myself doing this, I'll just reach out instead of
      second-guessing how much contact is too much contact. After all &mdash; in
      this case there was literally no other person I could ask for help!
