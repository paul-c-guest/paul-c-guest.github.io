    <h1>On Assigning Class And Identity</h1>
    <h3>
      thoughts and best practices on how to apply each in your html and css
    </h3>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      HTML looks a lot better with a bit of style. The rules that make up a
      style can be put together in reusable categories. By creating and applying
      these categories the developer can both save time, and present a
      consistent experience for the user.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, when deciding to create one of these stylistic categories, there
      is already a choice. Should the developer create a class, or an ID?
    </p>
    <p>
      A lifetime ago, when I was an arts degree undergraduate, we were bombarded
      with the concepts of class and identity. You might think an arts degree
      and styling your HTML with CSS would have nothing in common &mdash; but I
      reckon there's a good reason why the terminology of class and ID have
      shown up here.
    </p>
    <h2>Class</h2>
    <p>
      Arts degree academics love to talk about class! Let's use a simplified
      version of Karl Marx's theory of class structure in an industrialised
      society. Whoever you are in that society, you'll probably get pigeon-holed
      into one of two classes (remember, just keeping it simple here). In this
      structure, it's pretty likely that you're either:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>a worker, or</li>
      <li>a member of the elite</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The bit to keep in your mind here is that
      <strong>many individuals can be assigned the same class.</strong>
    </p>
    <h2>Identity</h2>
    <p>
      Arts degree academics also love to talk about identity! Every individual
      has their own unique mix of qualifications, personality quirks, and food
      allergies that make them who they are. On top of that, even if it were
      possible to make two people exactly the same &mdash; there would now be
      two of them, physically forced to take different paths.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the HTML realm, identity is shortened to 'id'. The bit to keep in your
      mind here is that
      <strong>id should only be assigned to a single individual.</strong>
    </p>
    <h2>Priority</h2>
    <p>
      Academics love to debate whether class or identity is more important! In
      the HTML world, it's been decided for us to avoid messy class struggles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most important thing to HTML is identity, and <em>then</em>
      class. Think of those animated films where the main characters are always
      fiercely individual, because of the unique combination of their personal
      traits.
    </p>
    <h2>In Practice</h2>
    <p>
      When the web developer is constructing their style categories, they can
      create a structure that allows for uniformity <em>and</em> individualism
      in the same room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uniformity, the repetition of styles on a page by the use of 'class', is
      an important tool to aid the website visitor. Consistency will help them
      quickly recognise the purpose of similar elements, like how these
      paragraphs are visually different from the headings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Individualism, in this case the use of 'id', lets the developer elevate
      chosen elements out of mediocrity. Now freed from their dull class
      restrictions, they can be called up by their unique name, and wear that
      incredible one-of-a-kind shirt.
    </p>
    <h2>Proceed with Care</h2>
    <p>
      Many classes can be assigned to a single element! This is fine though, in
      fact it's normal. The element will simply pay attention to the last thing
      it was told to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, in the same manner, many ids can also be given to an
      element. This is highly unrecommended, and now it's hopefully a bit
      clearer why. When we call up that id, hoping it's a unique element on our
      page, which one would we get..?
    </p>
    <h2>Combinations</h2>
    <p>
      Have a look at the CSS below, and we'll consider the results of applying
      different combinations of it to some HTML elements. Ids start with a hash
      and classes start with a dot:
    </p>
    <img src="../images/marx-css.png" />
    <p>We could assign a single class to an element without issue:</p>
    <img src="../images/worker.png" />
    <p>
      We can choose both classes, and remember &mdash; this is common. Now,
      since the elite class declaration comes last in the CSS file, it will
      override any similar values that were set previously. In this case none of
      the worker attributes will remain:
    </p>
    <img src="../images/double-agent.png" />
    <p>
      So what would happen if we give our element the karl-marx id? Despite
      Karl's attempts to side with the workers, the attributes that come with
      his id will not be overridden by conflicting class values:
    </p>
    <img src="../images/karl-marx-id.png" />

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      I hope I've helped to make class and id in HTML and CSS less fuzzy. I also
      apologise should you suddenly find the urge to smash the system, and build
      a log cabin in the woods.
