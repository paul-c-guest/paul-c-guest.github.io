    <h1>On Assigning Class And Identity</h1>
    <h3>
      thoughts and best practices on how to apply each in your html and css
    </h3>
    <h3 class="date">22 June 2023</h3>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      HTML looks a lot better with a bit of style. The rules that make up a
      style can be put together in reusable categories. By creating and applying
      these categories the developer can both save time, and present a
      consistent experience for the user.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, when deciding to create one of these stylistic categories, there
      is already a choice. Should the developer create a class, or an ID?
    </p>
    <p>
      When I studied sociology, we were absolutely saturated with the concepts
      of class and identity. You might think an arts degree and HTML styles
      would have nothing in common &mdash; but I reckon they share a couple of
      concepts quite strongly.
    </p>
    <h2>Class</h2>
    <p>
      Arts degree academics love to talk about class! Let's use a simplified
      version of Karl Marx's theory of class structure in an industrialised
      society. Whoever you are in that society, you'll probably get pigeon-holed
      into one of two classes (remember, just keeping it simple here). In this
      structure, it's pretty likely that you're either:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>a worker, or</li>
      <li>a member of the elite</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The bit to keep in your mind here is that
      <strong>many individuals can be assigned the same class.</strong>
    </p>
    <h2>Identity</h2>
    <p>
      Arts degree academics also love to talk about identity! Every individual
      has their own unique mix of qualifications, personality quirks, and food
      allergies that make them who they are. On top of that, even if it were
      possible to make two people exactly the same &mdash; there would now be
      two of them, destined for different paths.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the HTML realm, identity is shortened to 'id'. The bit to keep in your
      mind here is that
      <strong>id should only be assigned to a single individual.</strong>
    </p>
    <h2>Priority</h2>
    <p>
      You guessed it, academics love to debate whether class or identity is more
      important in society. In the HTML world, it's been decided for us to avoid
      messy class struggles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most important thing to HTML is <strong>identity</strong>, and then
      class. Think of those animated films where the main characters are always
      uniquely individual, because of the unique combination of their personal
      traits.
    </p>
    <h2>In Practice</h2>
    <p>
      When the web developer is constructing their style categories, they can
      create a structure that allows for uniformity <em>and</em> individualism
      in the same place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uniformity, the repetition of styles on a page by the use of 'class', is
      an important tool to aid the visitor. Consistency will help them quickly
      recognise the purpose of similar elements, like how these paragraphs are
      visually different from the headings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Individualism, in this case the use of 'id', lets the developer make
      chosen elements special. As well as now being freed from their class
      restrictions telling them to be a certain way, now they can be called up
      by their unique name, and wear that incredible one-of-a-kind shirt.
    </p>
    <h2>Proceed with Care</h2>
    <p>
      Many classes can be assigned to an element! This is fine though, in fact
      it's normal. The element will simply pay attention to the last thing it
      was told to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, many ids can also be given to an element. While it's
      possible, it's highly unrecommended, and now it's hopefully a bit clearer
      why. When we call up that id, hoping it's a unique element on our page,
      which one do we get..?
    </p>
    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      I hope I've helped to make class and id in HTML and CSS less fuzzy. I also
      apologise should you suddenly find the urge to smash the system, build a
      log cabin in the woods, or straight-up question whether you're even here.
