    <h3>dimensions of wellbeing</h3>
    <h3 class="date">3 July 2023</h3>
    <p>
      Te Whare Tapa Whā is a model of the four dimensions of wellbeing,
      developed by Tā Mason Durie in 1984 to provide a Māori perspective on
      health. Here are most of the things I do to keep my four walls standing: 
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <h2>Taha Tinana</h2>
          <p>
            I look after my physical wellbeing by walking, running, cycling,
            avoiding takeaway food, not eating meat, cooking for myself, not
            using soap, and not using drugs.
          </p>
        </td>
        <td>
          <h2>Taha Whānau</h2>
          <p>
            I look after my wellbeing by connecting with my friends for a chat
            or a laugh, and seeking out people that I can be myself around.
          </p>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <h2>Taha Hinengaro</h2>
          <p>
            I look after my mental & emotional wellbeing by talking openly with
            someone special; but also by letting my mind drift while running.
          </p>
        </td>
        <td>
          <h2>Taha Wairua</h2>
          <p>
            Although I am not a spiritual person, I look after this aspect of my
            wellbeing by being a principled person; acting honestly and trusting
            in others. I look up to the night sky in humility to remind myself
            of my own insignificance.
          </p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <table class="hangingTableCell">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <h2>Whenua</h2>
          <p>
            I connect with the land often. I greet the native birds as they
            pass; I acknowledge and respect the age of the native forest. I
            enjoy being outside in the rain; I enjoy floating in the surf.
          </p>
