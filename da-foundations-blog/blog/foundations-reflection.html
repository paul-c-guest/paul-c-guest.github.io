    <h1>Reflections On Foundations</h1>
    <p class="question">
      What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due
      to the core learning?
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>I am probably more empathetic than I give myself credit for</li>
      <li>I like being listened to <em>properly</em></li>
      <li>
        Distracting myself when stuck on problems isn't always a bad thing
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <p class="question">
      What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
      programming?
    </p>
    <p>
      Being aware of your own learning style, and your own stumbling blocks will
      help you get through your own problems &mdash; while also allowing you to
      recognise similar struggles in other learners and help them through it in
      a way that you would also like to be helped.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
    </p>
    <p>
      Dragging thoughts out into the light, and putting words to those thoughts
      has been good. Particularly around reflecting on listening & looping: I
      was able to identify and evaluate the way I want to be listened to when I
      am trying to talk about something new. Turns out I like to have a clear
      uninterrrupted space to vocally brainstorm my way through it.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
    </p>
    <p>
      Simply, the task of really taking some time to reflect on myself and put
      words to my thoughts.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
      focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    </p>
    <p>
      When I am describing the course content to others, and get to the
      <strong>core</strong> part, I usually tell them something about how anyone
      can 'learn to code', but those people will likely not bring 'the whole
      package' to a team. I feel that what Dev Academy is trying to acheive is
      to create developers that will not simply be a bit more prepared for their
      first job, but will be valuable team members right off the bat; equipped
      and prepared for the next position and the next, introducing more and more
      human skills to the leadership ranks of the industry over time.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
      time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead?
      Justify your answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a waste of time. I can predict that including this focus on knowing
      ourselves and respecting others will become very important in the coming
      weeks as the work starts getting more intense, when something goes wrong,
      when somebody else breaks something; our reactions and how we move forward
      through each setback will make all the difference. Each problem that we
      overcome as empathetic developers will make us better and better at
      dealing with the next setback.
